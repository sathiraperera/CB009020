    <h2>'Reuseable Snack Wraps'</h2>
    
    <p>Many school children and office workers use lunch sheets to carry their 
        food to school or work. However, this new initiative will take this a step
        further. 'Reusable sandwich wraps' will stop you from throwing a lunch sheet 
        each day, which is a great help to the environment as well as your pocket.

<h2>Recycled seat belt guitar straps</h2>

<p>Unusable vehicle seat belts have now been given life. Seat belts have been used
    to attach to guitars instead of the tradtional guitar straps. This new initiative 
    expects to reduce the huge amount of thrown away seat belts from vehicles which are 
    not taken in during the recycling process of metal parts. These are even taken from old 
    aeroplanes.
