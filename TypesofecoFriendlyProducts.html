        <h3>
            Metal Straws
        </h3>
        <p>Plastic straws are designed for single use. 
            So many restaurants all around Sri Lanka throw away a vast amount of plasic straws,
            which may end up in the sea harming out marine organisms. So we thougt that the use of  reusable, 
            stainless steel straws but be a feaible alternative to the disposable ones. They are also at a very affordable 
            rate, which will also reduce the expenditures of restarutants.

         <h3>Bamboo Toothbrush</h3>
         <p>Plastic Toothbrushes are also a huge threat to the environment. Not only because of the vast quantities
             but due to its bristles which get stuck inside the respitory systems and even alimentary cannals of 
             marine organsims. Toothbrushes have been a huge threat to the marine life especially during the past 
             few decades. Bamboo Toothbrushes are bio-degradable so have no threat to the environment even if burnt,
             as they are carbon neutral.

         <h3>Bags</h3>
         <p>Cloth bags are becoming more common within the society today. That's why we decided to promote 
            the use of cloth bags by making them affordable and more fashionable. These range in vast variety of designs,
            including the tradional Sri Lankan designs and more modern designs

         <h3>Dung Paper</h3>
         <p>Paper manufacurers cut down a lot of trees to make paper. We promote the use of paper made out of elephant dung.
             Dung of elephants from the Pinnawala elephant orphanage and many more are collected, dred and pressed to create 
             perfectly usable paper at a cheap cost, without felling a single tree.
